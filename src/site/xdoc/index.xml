	    <subsection name="Goal">
	      <p>
		The Hmtldocs plugin's goal is to simplify the site administration page.
		In fact it allows to create and edit portlets content with the tinyMCE "inlite" theme editor, which permits to paste tabs, images, lutece links and of course html content.
		The Htmldoc object contains the author name and all previous versions that can be easily restored at any moment.

            <subsection name="Usage">
                <p>
		  There is two ways to create an htmldoc portlet :
		    - Create an Htmldoc document in the admin feature then link it to a new portlet
		    - Dynamically create an htmldoc portlet on the "site administration" page, and directly fill it in with the content of your choice
		  Moreover, every changes applied to either the portlet or it's linked Htmldoc is applied to the other.
